<b> Course Curriculum: Programming Fundamentals with Java </b>

**<ins>Language Comparison</ins>**: During this module, I compared different programming languages, including Java, and understood their similarities and differences.

**<ins>Basic Syntax, Conditional Statements, and Loops</ins>**: In this module, I learned the basic syntax of Java, including variables, data types, and operators. I explored conditional statements such as if-else and switch, as well as loop constructs like for, while, and do-while.

**<ins>Git and GitHub</ins>**: Over the course of this module, I gained proficiency in using Git, a version control system, and GitHub, a web-based hosting platform for Git repositories. I learned how to manage and collaborate on projects using Git and GitHub.

**<ins>Data Types and Variables</ins>**: In this module, I delved deeper into data types in Java, including primitive and reference types. I learned about variables, their scope, and how to manipulate data using operators.

**<ins>HTTP Basics</ins>**: Understanding the basics of the HTTP protocol is essential for web development. I learned about HTTP methods, status codes, and request/response headers.

**<ins>Arrays</ins>**: Arrays are fundamental data structures in Java. In this module, I learned how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays, as well as perform common operations on array elements.

**<ins>HTML & CSS Basics</ins>**: This module introduced me to HTML and CSS, the building blocks of web development. I learned the basics of creating web pages and styling them using CSS.

**<ins>Methods</ins>**: In this module, I learned how to create and use methods in Java. I explored the concept of method overloading, passing arguments, and returning values.

**<ins>Software Development Concepts - Part 1</ins>**: This module introduced me to important software development concepts, including code organization, modular programming, and code usability. I learned best practices for writing maintainable and scalable code.

**<ins>List</ins>**: The List data structure is an essential part of Java collections. In this module, I learned how to use Lists to store and manipulate collections of objects.

**<ins>Objects and Classes</ins>**: In this module, I learned about objects and classes in Java. I explored the concepts of constructors.

**<ins>Software Development Concepts - Part 2</ins>**: Building upon the concepts covered in Part 1, this module further explored software development concepts such as abstraction, interfaces, and exception handling. I enhanced my understanding of writing robust and maintainable code.

**<ins>Associative Arrays</ins>**: In this module, I learned how to use associative arrays in Java to store key-value pairs.

**<ins>Bitwise Operations</ins>**: This module covered bitwise operations in Java, including AND, OR, XOR, shifting, and complement. 

**<ins>Text Processing</ins>**: In this module, I learned about text processing techniques in Java. I explored manipulating strings, searching, and replacing patterns, and performing other common text processing operations.

**<ins>Problem-Solving</ins>**: In this module, I developed my problem-solving skills. I learned various techniques and approaches to tackle programming challenges efficiently.

**<ins>Regular Expressions</ins>**: In this module, I learned about regular expressions in Java and how to use them effectively for searching, matching, and manipulating text patterns.

By completing the "Programming Fundamentals with Java" course, I have acquired a strong foundation in Java programming, including knowledge of syntax, conditional statements, loops, data types, objects, and essential software development concepts.
