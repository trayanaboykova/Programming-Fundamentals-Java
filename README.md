<b> Course Curriculum: Programming Fundamentals with Java </b>

**<ins>Language Comparison</ins>**: During this module, I compared different programming languages, including Java, and understood their similarities and differences.

**[Basic Syntax, Conditional Statements, and Loops](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Fundamentals-Java/tree/master/src/Lesson01_BasicSyntax)**: In this module, I learned the basic syntax of Java, including variables, data types, and operators. I explored conditional statements such as if-else and switch, as well as loop constructs like for, while, and do-while.

**<ins>Git and GitHub</ins>**: Over the course of this module, I gained proficiency in using Git, a version control system, and GitHub, a web-based hosting platform for Git repositories. I learned how to manage and collaborate on projects using Git and GitHub.

**[Data Types and Variables](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Fundamentals-Java/tree/master/src/Lesson02_DataTypesAndVariables)**: In this module, I delved deeper into data types in Java, including primitive and reference types. I learned about variables, their scope, and how to manipulate data using operators.

**<ins>HTTP Basics</ins>**: Understanding the basics of the HTTP protocol is essential for web development. I learned about HTTP methods, status codes, and request/response headers.

**[Arrays](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Fundamentals-Java/tree/master/src/Lesson03_Arrays)**: Arrays are fundamental data structures in Java. In this module, I learned how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays, as well as perform common operations on array elements.

**[HTML & CSS Basics](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Fundamentals-Java/tree/master/src/Lesson00_Common/HTML%26CSS)**: This module introduced me to HTML and CSS, the building blocks of web development. I learned the basics of creating web pages and styling them using CSS.

**[Methods](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Fundamentals-Java/tree/master/src/Lesson04_Methods)**: In this module, I learned how to create and use methods in Java. I explored the concept of method overloading, passing arguments, and returning values.

**<ins>Software Development Concepts - Part 1</ins>**: This module introduced me to important software development concepts, including code organization, modular programming, and code usability. I learned best practices for writing maintainable and scalable code.

**[List](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Fundamentals-Java/tree/master/src/Lesson05_Lists)**: The List data structure is an essential part of Java collections. In this module, I learned how to use Lists to store and manipulate collections of objects.

**[Objects and Classes](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Fundamentals-Java/tree/master/src/Lesson06_ObjectsAndClasses)**: In this module, I learned about objects and classes in Java. I explored the concepts of constructors.

**<ins>Software Development Concepts - Part 2</ins>**: Building upon the concepts covered in Part 1, this module further explored software development concepts such as abstraction, interfaces, and exception handling. I enhanced my understanding of writing robust and maintainable code.

**[Associative Arrays](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Fundamentals-Java/tree/master/src/Lesson07_AssociativeArrays)**: In this module, I learned how to use associative arrays in Java to store key-value pairs.

**[Bitwise Operations](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Fundamentals-Java/tree/master/src/Lesson00_Common/BitwiseOperations)**: This module covered bitwise operations in Java, including AND, OR, XOR, shifting, and complement. 

**[Text Processing](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Fundamentals-Java/tree/master/src/Lesson08_TextProcessing)**: In this module, I learned about text processing techniques in Java. I explored manipulating strings, searching, and replacing patterns, and performing other common text processing operations.

**<ins>Problem-Solving</ins>**: In this module, I developed my problem-solving skills. I learned various techniques and approaches to tackle programming challenges efficiently.

**[Regular Expressions](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Fundamentals-Java/tree/master/src/Lesson09_RegularExpressions)**: In this module, I learned about regular expressions in Java and how to use them effectively for searching, matching, and manipulating text patterns.

By completing the "Programming Fundamentals with Java" course, I have acquired a strong foundation in Java programming, including knowledge of syntax, conditional statements, loops, data types, objects, and essential software development concepts.
