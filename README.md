<b> Course Curriculum: Programming Fundamentals with Java </b>

Language Comparison: During this module, I compared different programming languages, including Java, and understood their similarities and differences.

Basic Syntax, Conditional Statements, and Loops: In this module, I learned the basic syntax of Java, including variables, data types, and operators. I explored conditional statements such as if-else and switch, as well as loop constructs like for, while, and do-while.

Git and GitHub: Over the course of this module, I gained proficiency in using Git, a version control system, and GitHub, a web-based hosting platform for Git repositories. I learned how to manage and collaborate on projects using Git and GitHub.

Data Types and Variables: In this module, I delved deeper into data types in Java, including primitive and reference types. I learned about variables, their scope, and how to manipulate data using operators.

HTTP Basics: Understanding the basics of the HTTP protocol is essential for web development. I learned about HTTP methods, status codes, and request/response headers.

Arrays: Arrays are fundamental data structures in Java. In this module, I learned how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays, as well as perform common operations on array elements.

HTML & CSS Basics: This module introduced me to HTML and CSS, the building blocks of web development. I learned the basics of creating web pages and styling them using CSS.

Methods: In this module, I learned how to create and use methods in Java. I explored the concept of method overloading, passing arguments, and returning values.

Software Development Concepts - Part 1: This module introduced me to important software development concepts, including code organization, modular programming, and code usability. I learned best practices for writing maintainable and scalable code.

List: The List data structure is an essential part of Java collections. In this module, I learned how to use Lists to store and manipulate collections of objects.

Objects and Classes: In this module, I learned about objects and classes in Java. I explored the concepts of constructors.

Software Development Concepts - Part 2: Building upon the concepts covered in Part 1, this module further explored software development concepts such as abstraction, interfaces, and exception handling. I enhanced my understanding of writing robust and maintainable code.

Associative Arrays: In this module, I learned how to use associative arrays in Java to store key-value pairs.

Bitwise Operations: This module covered bitwise operations in Java, including AND, OR, XOR, shifting, and complement. 

Text Processing: In this module, I learned about text processing techniques in Java. I explored manipulating strings, searching, and replacing patterns, and performing other common text processing operations.

Problem-Solving: In this module, I developed my problem-solving skills. I learned various techniques and approaches to tackle programming challenges efficiently.

Regular Expressions: In this module, I learned about regular expressions in Java and how to use them effectively for searching, matching, and manipulating text patterns.

By completing the "Programming Fundamentals with Java" course, I have acquired a strong foundation in Java programming, including knowledge of syntax, conditional statements, loops, data types, objects, and essential software development concepts.
